Hi! Thank you for joining my tutorials this semester! Here is the Zusammenfassung i made myself while i was studying for my exams. These are mostly just screenshots i took from my year's slides and not original content. There is no guarantee on it being correct, fully encapsulating all relevant themes or guarantee that all themes in the slides are relevant to the exam. This is also not the only studying i did! I practiced with many exercises! Practice makes perfect :) but don't worry, I believe in you all! You got this!
