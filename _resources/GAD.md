[Carlos Camino](https://www.carlos-camino.de/gad.html) has a collection of helpful files - ranging from a trainer to a summary - on this topic.

I used this [GAD TL;DR](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/gadtldr.pdf) to create my cheat sheet for the exam :)

The [VL from 2022](https://live.rbg.tum.de/?year=2022&term=S&slug=gad&view=3) are very good and helped me understand some themes better.
