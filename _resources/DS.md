[Carlos Camino](https://carlos-camino.de/ds.html)'s [DS Trainer](https://carlos-camino.de/resources/ds+trainer.pdf) is a helpful summary of the course. Keep in mind that which topics are taught may have changed over the years.


Milena, a tutor from WS21/22, graciously shared her [Zusammenfassung](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/DsMilena.pdf) with us. I personally based some parts of my cheat sheet on this.

Vera, a tutor in WS24/25, also has a website with her solutions to the exercise sheets and extra resources! I strongly recommend you check [her website](https://catundercover.github.io/ds-tutorium/index.html) out!
