[OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html) is a very helpful website for when you have any question marks about OCaml or need a refresher on the language. Alternatively, you can also watch the content of the book in this [youtube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLre5AT9JnKShBOPeuiD9b-I4XROIJhkIU&si=pPpNfMGZBrBEs6wS).
