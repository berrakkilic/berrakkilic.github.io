This [Übungsskript](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/eidiubungsskript.pdf) can come in handy when you're going over all topics for EIDI :) [Here](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/eidilosung.pdf) are the answers to the exercises in the Übungsskript.

This [Polymorphie Überblick](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/polymorphie.pdf) is so helpful in really understanding the core concepts of Polymorphie.

A tutor shared his [old cheat sheet](http://berrakkilic.github.io/files/cheatsheetvontutor.pdf) for EIDI. Please keep in mind how the curriculum may have changed over time.
